Monfongo is made by mashing tostones (twice fried plantains) with garlic, olive oil, and chicarrones or bacon.

3 green plantains
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
½ lb. chicharrón or cooked bacon (crumbled)
Vegetable oil for frying

First make tostones . . . .

Mix together the garlic olive oil and chicharron or bacon.

Mash the tostones, a few at a time in the pilon (never use a food processor), adding a little bit of the garlic mixture. You will have to work a few slices at a time. When all done mix all the batches together for even distribution of seasoning. Add salt if needed. This is a side dish that needs to be served warm. Keep forming balls until mixture is all used up.

Serve with fried pork meat and fried onions, or with soup, or as a side dish….. yummy!

Use this same recipe to make "Bolitas de Mofongo" to add to stews. Shape the mixture into balls and drop in any soup.
